Project introduction:
First I used these commands to install the frameworks for react i use 'npm install react-flags-select --save' and 'npm install react-hook-form'. 
And next to make sure that the computer has Node and npm installed to run this project. Next step would just be to run the command 'npm run start' and the page should open on a localhost address in the default browser.  

React is used for building the user interface and using typescript like required in the task. I used the default css to do this page.
The react-hook-form framework i found pretty easy to implement and perfomance also to be good.
The react-flags-select is a simple flag selector drop-down list I found that is using React. 

I am sure the page can be optimized a lot and things done faster. The less different frameworks the project uses the faster the bundle compiles and overrall perfomance of the project improves. I used 2 different frameworks for my project.
I read that the possibilities to improve the bundle are like implementing lazy loading to the page which is basically asynchronous loading, loading the  component only when its needed 





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
